= idris2-echidna Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for idris2-echidna.

== Current Status: Scaffolding Complete (45%)

The core library structure is in place with working integration modules.

== Phase 1: Core FFI (Target: Q1 2025)

=== Milestone 1.1: FFI Foundation
* [ ] Create C header file (`echidna.h`) for FFI bindings
* [ ] Implement memory management helpers for FFI boundary
* [ ] Add error code translation from C to Idris2
* [ ] Test basic FFI calls compile and link

=== Milestone 1.2: Z3 Integration
* [ ] Complete Z3 FFI implementation
* [ ] Add SMT-LIB serialization/deserialization
* [ ] Implement proof result parsing
* [ ] Add unit tests with actual Z3 calls

=== Milestone 1.3: Error Handling
* [ ] Define comprehensive error types
* [ ] Add timeout handling
* [ ] Implement graceful degradation
* [ ] Add logging/tracing support

== Phase 2: Full Prover Support (Target: Q2 2025)

=== Milestone 2.1: Tier 1 Provers
* [ ] CVC5 implementation
* [ ] Lean 4 implementation
* [ ] Coq implementation
* [ ] Agda implementation

* [ ] Aspect-based prover selection

== Phase 4: Production Ready (Target: Q4 2025)

=== Milestone 4.1: Testing & Quality
* [ ] Property-based tests for all modules
* [ ] Integration test suite
* [ ] Performance benchmarks
* [ ] Memory leak testing

=== Milestone 4.2: Documentation
* [ ] Complete API documentation
